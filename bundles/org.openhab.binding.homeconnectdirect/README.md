# Home Connect Direct Binding

The Home Connect Direct Binding integrates [Home Connect](https://www.home-connect.com/) enabled devices into openHAB.
It allows seamless communication with your appliances over your local network.
This ensures reliable and secure operation without requiring any cloud access.
To get started, the configuration of your appliances needs to be loaded once during the initial setup.

This binding is built upon the outstanding work of the following projects:
- [osresearch/hcpy](https://github.com/osresearch/hcpy)
- [hcpy2-0/hcpy](https://github.com/hcpy2-0/hcpy)

A big thank you to the contributors of these projects for their excellent work!

## Discovery

Things are discovered via mDNS on the local network. Alternatively, you can add devices manually by IP address.

## Thing Configuration

### Load Appliance Profiles

This binding provides a dedicated web user interface to manage and interact with your Home Connect-enabled appliances.
It allows you to configure appliance profiles, which contain the keys and descriptions required for communication with your home devices.

1. **Open the Home Connect Direct Console**  
   The binding includes a separate user interface accessible through your web browser at: `http(s)://[YOUROPENHAB]:[YOURPORT]/homeconnectdirect`  
   For example: `http://192.168.178.100:8080/homeconnectdirect`
2. **Navigate to Appliance Profiles**  
   Once on the console page, open the **"Appliance Profiles"** menu.
3. **Managing Profiles**
   In the top-right corner of the "Appliance Profiles" page, you will find the button`Upload Profile`. Use this option to import appliance profiles that have been previously downloaded or saved.   
   > **Important Note:**
   Unfortunately, an additional tool must be used to load the profiles, as the previously integrated fetch tool no longer works.  
   To load the profiles, use the following tool:
   > - **Project Repository:** [HomeConnect Profile Downloader](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader)
   > - **Latest Releases:** [Download Releases](https://github.com/bruestel/homeconnect-profile-downloader/releases)
   
   ![Screenshot Home Connect Direct Binding UI](doc/update-profiles.png "Update Profiles")
   
> **INFO:** You can also download and securely store these profiles at any time, ensuring you always have a backup of your appliance configurations.

### Create Things

You can discover and add Home Connect devices in multiple ways:

- **Automatic Discovery via UPnP**:  
  Use the UPnP feature to scan your network and automatically find supported Home Connect devices.

- **Manual Configuration**:  
  If automatic discovery is not suitable for your environment, you can manually add devices either through a `things` file or by using the openHAB UI.

#### Thing configuration parameters

| Name            | Type    | Description                                                                                                       | Default         | Required | Advanced |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|----------|----------|
| haId        | text    | Unique identifier representing a specific home appliance. The `haId` (Home Appliance ID) can be found in the Home Connect Direct console. It is displayed on the "Appliance Profile" page.                                                        | N/A             | yes      | no       |
| address        | text    | Address of home appliance (hostname or IP)                                                                        | N/A             | yes      | no       |
| connectionRetryDelay | integer | Reconnect delay in minutes (min: 1 max: 60)                                                                       | 1               | no       | yes      |

## Binding Configuration (optional)

### HTTP Basic Authentication

The HTTP Basic Authentication settings are used to protect the separate binding web console.
If you wish to secure this page, you can define a username and password here.
Basic authentication is deactivated by default.

### Configuration Methods

Both configuration groups can be managed either via the **openHAB UI** or the **OSGi Console**.

#### Configuration via openHAB UI
1. Navigate to:  
   **Administration** -> **Settings** -> **Add-on Settings** -> **Home Connect Direct**

#### Configuration via OSGi Console
1. Open the console (e.g., `ssh -p 8101 openhab@localhost`)
2. Run the following commands:
   ```shell
   openhab> config:edit binding.homeconnectdirect
   openhab> config:property-set basicAuthEnabled [true or false]
   openhab> config:property-set basicAuthUsername [Home Connect Direct Console username]
   openhab> config:property-set basicAuthPassword [Home Connect Direct Console password]
   openhab> config:property-list
   openhab> config:update

## Channels

The binding comes with a wide range of preconfigured channels, making it easy to control and monitor your Home Connect devices.  
However, due to the large number of options, settings, and features available, not all possible configurations can be supported by default.

To address this, the binding also provides the ability to add **Dynamic Channels**.  
This allows you to customize the setup to suit your specific needs and extend the functionality of your Home Connect integration.

## Preconfigured Channels

| Channel ID                  | Item Type            | Read only | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Available on thing                                                                      |

## Dynamic Channels

| Channel Type Id | Type   | Read/Write | Description                                                            |
|-----------------|--------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| switch          | Switch | RW         | This channel type can be used to represent boolean values as switches. |
| string          | String | RW         | This channel type can be used to represent strings.                    |
| number          | Number | RW         | This channel type can be used to represent number values.              |

For dynamic channels, it is necessary to specify an `eventKey` parameter.
This parameter determines which event from the home appliance the channel should listen to.
The easiest way to find the appropriate event key is by referring to the communication log.
Please take a look at the message with the resource `/ro/allMandatoryValues` in the log to identify the correct event key.

## Full Example

Below is an example of how to configure and use a Home Connect device with the openHAB Home Connect Direct Binding using textual configuration files (`*.things` and `*.items`).

### Thing Configuration

```java

    Channels:
        Type switch     : brandLogo                     "Brand Logo"      [ eventKey = "Dishcare.Dishwasher.Setting.BrandLogo" ]
        Type string     : timeFormat                    "Time Format"     [ eventKey = "Dishcare.Dishwasher.Setting.TimeFormat" ]
}

```

_contact.map_

```perl

CLOSED=closed
ON=opened
OFF=closed
=unknown
```

## Misc

### Web UI behind reverse proxy

If you are accessing the openHAB UI through a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx), ensure that the reverse proxy is correctly configured to allow WebSocket connections. The console relies on a WebSocket connection to the openHAB backend to facilitate communication between the binding and your Home Connect device. Without proper WebSocket support, certain UI functionalities may not work as intended.
